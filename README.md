Here I occasionally dump copies of the articles I wrote or contributed to
in the illumos/OI/OmniOS/... area. Originals remain "developed" on their
respective Wikis. These are backups just in case ;)

For practical code that appeared from some of these articles, please see:

* https://github.com/jimklimov/illumos-splitroot-scripts
* https://github.com/jimklimov/illumos-smf-zfspools
* https://github.com/jimklimov/illumos-smf-zones

...and loosely related by general theme:
